# Who is teaching my math section?

Unlike many of the other departments within UW the math department is not completely transparent with who is teaching its courses. There is no unified area as of yet to get this data so this program scrapes what it can find. For now this is whatever is on the professors page on the faculty website (if you find this information somewhere else publically accessable please let me know).

This program also pulls from RateMyProfessor.com to present the rating next to the professor when possible. This data is nutoriously innacurate however so use it at your own risk. My own professor (prof Athreya) is currently listed with the lowest rating of the department (a 1.6) yet he is actually a super nice professor that does a brilliant job of explaining thing and keeping good notes and resources on his website.

All of this data is then put into text files that you can refer to at a later date

This data is then compiled into a series of informative lists allowing you to
 - See all the facts scraped (BigPrint.txt)
 - See what each professor is teaching (By Professor.txt)
 - See what professor is teaching each section for a given class (By Class.txt)
 - All the professors listed as teaching courses this quarter ranked by their rating (Professor Ranking.txt)

 This program does take a *very long* time to run and so please run it only occasionally. Usually I will have the data pre-scraped on a folder on this repo.

 Please let me know if there is data missing or innacurate that I should have gotten so I can update the scraper.
